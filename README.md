# Remote-work-survey-during-pandemic

Introduction
The Pandemic has changed our daily life in a significant way, especially for our academic instruction mode and working style. When we look back to the beginning of the current pandemic, we want to ask whether the employers and the employees were well prepared for this pandemic or not, did all employees have equal opportunities to take remote working?

Purpose
In this analysis, we want to answer:
Who are they?
What is their employerâ€™s attitude about remote working before and during the pandemic? How do their employers prepare for remote working?
Is there any difference between different industries?
How has the COVID pandemic affected the amount of work gets done remotely?
Does working remotely impact productivity in a positive way? Are there any other benefits?


Data Description
The data set
Survey results of 1,500 remote workers from the Australian state of New South Wales, taken in August-September 2020, aimed to capture the remote work experiences and attitudes at the height of the COVID lockdown. The data contains 1507 rows and 73 columns, while in our analysis, we will choose 41 columns.
